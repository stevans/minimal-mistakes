I am a recent graduate from the astrophysics Ph.D. program at the
University of Texas at Austin working in the field of galaxy evolution.
My interest in using the scientific method to solve problems that 
expand our collective understanding of the cosmos has grown to include problems 
that impact people here on Earth. This is why I am pursuing a career in data science.
 
Iâ€™m drawn to extracting deep insights from large data sets. I enjoy learning
new analytic techniques and visualization methods to share my findings with 
others, which is why I stared this blog. In my free time, I enjoy running, 
playing soccer, reading about politics, and cooking with my loving partner, Danielle.

My astrophysics research focused on understanding the evolution of galaxies 
over cosmic time. To do this, I used large multi-wavelegnth imaging surveys and 
machine learning to measure the physical properties of millions of galaxies. 
My Ph.D. thesis "Investigating Star-formation and Quiescence of Massive 
Galaxies in the Early Universe Using Wide-Field Imaging" explored the evolution of 
the most massive galaxies when the universe was less than 1/10 its current age.
