I am a recent graduate from the astrophysics Ph.D. program at the
University of Texas at Austin working in the field of galaxy evolution.
My interest in using the scientific method to understand and solve 
problems has grown to include problems that impact people in their day-to-day lives.
This has led me to pursue a career in data science.

The root of my passion for astronomy lies in investigating large datasets to
develop novel solutions and distill data-driven insights. I enjoy learning
new analytic techniques and visualization methods that allow me to apply my
experience as an astronomical researcher to non-astronomical problems, which
I blog about here. In my free time, I enjoy running, playing soccer, 
reading about politics, and cooking with my loving partner, Danielle.

My astrophysics research focuses on understanding the evolution of galaxies 
over cosmic time. To do this, I use large multi-wavelegnth imaging surveys and 
machine learning to measure the physical properties of millions of galaxies. 
My Ph.D. thesis "Investigating Star-formation and Quiescence of Massive 
Galaxies in the Early Universe Using Wide-Field Imaging" explores the evolution of 
the most massive galaxies when the universe was less than 1/10 its current age.
