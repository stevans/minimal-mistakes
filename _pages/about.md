I am a recent graduate from the astrophysics Ph.D. program at the University of Texas at Austin working in the field of galaxy evolution. I was drawn to astronomy by the stunning pictures and deep philosophical implications about the nature of reality, and I stayed for the challenge of extracting deep insights from large data sets. Now I want to use the skills I learned as an astronomer to solve problems that impact peoples lives here on Earth. This is why I am pursuing a career in data science.
 
I started this blog to demostrate my data science skills for potential employeers, but hopefully you will also learn a little about my background, what topics I find interesting, and new analytic techniques and visualization methods that Iâ€™ve acquired as an astronomer and wanna-be data scientist. In my free time, I enjoy playing soccer, reading about current events, economics, and governance, and cooking with my loving partner, Danielle.

My astrophysics research focused on understanding the evolution of galaxies over cosmic time. To do this, I used large multi-wavelegnth imaging surveys and machine learning to measure the physical properties of millions of galaxies. My Ph.D. thesis "Investigating Star-formation and Quiescence of Massive Galaxies in the Early Universe Using Wide-Field Imaging" explored the physics of the most massive galaxies when the universe was less than 1/10 its current age. A list of my research papers and conference proceedings can be found on the Astrophysics Data System using [this search.](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/q=author%3A(%22stevans%2C%20matthew%20louis%22)%20AND%20pubdate%3A%5B2011-01%20TO%20*%5D&sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc&p_=0)
